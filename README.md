# Dog_Breed_Classification_Project

This is Dog breed classification project is build in CNN -Convolution neural networks.
This app wil give an identify an estimate of any image given by user as input , that if it is a dog image or a human image or neither human nor dog. Then if it is a dog image it give the estimate that of which breed this canine belongs to. And if it is a human image the will give the guess of which dog breed this human resembles to.

## Overview of Project :

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)! In this project, you will learn how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
