# Dog_Breed_Classification_Project



## Overview of Project :

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)! In this project, you will learn how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canine’s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

### Steps throughout the project
Step 0: Import Datasets
Step 1: Detect Humans
Step 2: Detect Dogs
Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
Step 4: Use a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
Step 5: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
Step 6: Write your Algorithm
Step 7: Test Your Algorithm

### Data
We need a lot of different data to solve this problem, let’s start by downloading them:
1. Dog Images
2. Human Images
3. ResNet50 Features
4. OpenCV Human Face Detection Model

### Final results give following :

This is Dog breed classification project is build in CNN -Convolution neural networks.
This app wil give an identify an estimate of any image given by user as input , that if it is a dog image or a human image or neither human nor dog. Then if it is a dog image it give the estimate that of which breed this canine belongs to. And if it is a human image the will give the guess of which dog breed this human resembles to. And if an image is not of an human or a dog then it gives result as “This is neither a dog nor a human.”
